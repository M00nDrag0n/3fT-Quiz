# _Dragon Quiz_

#### _A remake of the second code review for Epicodus, 10/28/19_

#### By _**Anise Lester**_

## Description

_This is an attempt at overcomplicating a simple project involving the show and hide functions in JavaScript._

## List of specs

*_The program contains instructions on what is needed in a separate branch._
*_The program shows and hides certain results depending on specific data which is gathered from 5 questions._
*_The program exists._
*_Beware._


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Copy this link [  ] and paste it into your browser. _
* _Answer questions for fun!_


_No additional servers are needed._

## Known Bugs

_The current issue is that a few specific points of data show up as constants when they shouldn't. Each result is specified to a specific set of answers, yet it doesn't show up that way upon clicking the submit button. Current constants are "electricity"(element), "adolescent"(maturity), and transformation(power). Also the else function does not show when no data is submitted. Will update eventually._
